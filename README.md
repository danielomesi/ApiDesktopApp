Windows Desktop Application

I had some time in the weekend so I decided to take an API which I have encountered in during the semester, and decided to implement a simple Desktop Application that is fetching data from this API and presenting it to the user.
This App was made in C# in Visual Studio 2019 Enviornment.
Enjoy!

The mentioned API - OpenSky REST API
